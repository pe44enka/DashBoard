### Description 
This project is created as a part of **Data Visualization with Python** by IBM and supposed to create *US Domestic Airline Flights Performance Dashboard*

### Objectives
As a data analyst, you have been given a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance to analyze the performance and improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.

### Goal of the project

* Yearly airline performance report:
  * bar chart: monthly number of flights under different cancellation categories
  * line chart: average monthly flight time (minutes) by reporting airline
  * pie cahrt: percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline
  * choropleth map: number of flights flying from each state 
  * tree chart: number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline 
* Yearly average flight delay statistics: monthly average delay by reporting airline for the given year
  * carrier delay
  * weather delay
  * national air system delay
  * security delay 
  * late aircraft delay 


### Techniques
In this project I will use:
* **Data manipulation:** pandas
* **Chart plotting:** plotly
* **Dashboard building:** dash
* **Dashboard run:** ngrok
